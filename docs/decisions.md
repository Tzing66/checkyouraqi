# Decision log

Decisions not covered by the plan, newest first. Format: date — decision — why.

## 2026-09-28 — Airflow memory spike (idle)
- **Setup:** Airflow 3.1.0 (`apache/airflow:3.1.0-python3.12`), LocalExecutor, Postgres 16, no Celery/Redis, **no triggerer**, parallelism 4, one API worker. Per-service `mem_limit` caps add up to 1.6 GB: scheduler 700m, api-server 450m, dag-processor 250m, postgres 200m.
- **Why caps instead of shrinking Docker Desktop to 2 GB:** Docker Desktop's memory setting is global and would affect other projects. The caps model the t3.small's budget (2 GB minus about 0.4 GB for Amazon Linux and Docker).
- **Result, idle (6 samples over 2 min):** scheduler ~215 MiB, api-server ~210 MiB, dag-processor ~84–107 MiB, postgres ~73 MiB, **~605 MiB total**. About 1 GB is left for task processes inside the caps, plus a 2–4 GB swap file on EC2.
- **Still open:** measure under task load. The test DAG wasn't written in Phase 0 (a tooling block). The first real ingestion DAGs in Phase 1 will serve as the load test. If the scheduler cap OOMs, lower parallelism to 2 before resizing the instance.

## 2026-09-28 — Station set for v1
- **Model only reference monitors** (`isMonitor = true`, CPCB network plus the US Embassy). 54 pass the ≥70% rule. The 15 low-cost sensors that also pass are left out of v1.
- **CPCB → OpenAQ feed outage seen on 2026-09-24.** Every CPCB station went silent at the same moment, so ingestion has to handle feed-wide gaps, and freshness alerts should say "feed down" rather than flagging 50 stations. Rerun the spike after recovery.
- **Use the live sensor/location ID, not the first match.** OpenAQ keeps dead legacy sensors and duplicate locations for the same physical station.

## 2026-09-28 — AWS account and budget
- **Account:** new account on the credit-based Free plan, IAM admin user `tanz-admin` (root has MFA and isn't used). CLI profile `checkyouraqi`, region `ap-south-1`.
- **Credits:** USD 100, expiring **2027-09-28** (12 months, not the 6 the plan assumed). Up to USD 100 more is available from onboarding tasks.
- **Runway:** at the planned ~USD 20–25/month for EC2 from Phase 5, USD 100 lasts about 4–5 months of compute. **Credits, not the expiry date, will be the limit.** Earn the onboarding credits and revisit the exit plan (§3) about 3 months after Phase 5 goes live.
- **Budget deferred to Phase 1:** the USD 1 budget and zero-spend alert will be created in the Phase 1 Terraform, not by hand in Phase 0. This is low risk because the Free plan can't bill past its credits and nothing runs in AWS before Phase 1. It must exist **before any `terraform apply` that creates resources.**

## 2026-09-28 — Scaffold choices
- **Repo root is `CheckYourAQI/`** (not a nested `checkyouraqi/`). The plan moved to `docs/checkyouraqi-plan.md` as §11 lays out.
- **`[tool.uv] package = false`**: uv's editable-install `.pth` file gets the macOS hidden flag on this machine and Python 3.12 skips it. Code runs with `PYTHONPATH=.`; pytest sets `pythonpath`.
- **Delhi NCR bbox `[76.84, 28.35, 77.60, 28.90]`**: covers Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida/Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. We'll tighten it after the station spike if it picks up stray stations.
- **`festivals.csv`** holds Diwali only for now (2024 uses 31 Oct, the Delhi observance). Verify the dates and add others (e.g. Dussehra, New Year's Eve) before Phase 3 features.
